     SP equations return messages that go from each caluse to each variable node,
     and compute for each variable node surveys. A message sent from a clause c to a variable i
     informs the variable what is the best choice to do for satisfying clause c. This message is computed
     from the messages recived by remaining variables j into clause c, but distinct from i.
     All messages are computed iteratively till a fixed point shows up.
     In this code this procedure is obtained by the public member of class Graph convergence_messages().
     For details, we refer to technical specifications into class Graph.hpp and .cpp .
     Once a convergece is found, surveys for each variable node are computed. They are three,
     and each of them describes the probability that a variable node can be assigned to
     a true value, s_T, to a false value, s_F, or can be indeterminate s_I.
     This calculation, in this code, is performed by the public member surveys().
     For details, we refer to technical specifications in class Graph and class Vertex.
     Moreover, we also compute the certitude, defined as:
     
                                                s_C=(1.-min(s_T,s_F).
     
     This simple bias will help us to decide which variable(s) can be fixed or relased
     during decimation or backtracking procedure.*/

The choice between a decimation or a backtracking step is taken accordingly to a stochastic rule, where the parameter r ∈ [0,1) represents the ratio between backtracking steps to decimation steps [1]. When r=0 one obtains survey inspired decimation (SID), while when r!=0 one works with backtracking survey propagation. In this code r=_R_BSP into Header.h file.

       /* The main step in decimation procedure consists in starting from a problem with N variables and assign
        a variable node to reduce the order of the factor graph and its size, with the hope to make it simpler.
        This strategy proceeds in the following way. One chooses a variable node i with the largest value of
        certitude s_C, assigns this variable to true or false using the rule:
        
                                            i is TRUE if s_T>s_F;
                                            i if FALSE if s_F>s_T,
        
        and removes it from the factor graph. Then one removes, in according to the problem
        (i.e. if is a SAT, XORSAT or NAESAT), all the clauses that are satisfied by the assignment done, and in all
        cluases not sitisfied by the assignment of i, the literal associated is removed.
        In a faster version one can decimate L variable nodes with maximal s_C, where L = fN with f a small number,
        instead of decimate only one variable node each time. If one is not too near the critical point and f < .01
        the results are only weakly dependent on f [3,7].
        This procedure is described by two public members in class Graph, i.e. sort_V_Dec_move() and
        choose_var_to_fix_and_clean(). sort_V_Dec_move() helps us to pick up variable nodes with the highest value
        of certitude. It is a sort and the computational complexity is O(NlogN). choose_var_to_fix_and_clean()
        fixes variable nodes and cleans the graph, as described above. It has a computational complexity O(logN).
        Onece decimation step is terminated a new convergence of clause to variable messages is needed.
        This strategy proceeds iteratively till one of these conditions appears:
        
                1) all messages computed by SP equations are trivial, i.e. all of them are 0. In this case one is arrived to an "easy" region, called by physicist paramagnetic phase, where the residual graph can be solved using greedy or heuristic (polynomial)algorithms.
                2) SP equations does not find any fixed point. In this case we claim that the algorithm fails.

         It is not difficult to understand when it is worth releasing a variable.
         The bias of a not assigned variable node i, which we recall to be defined as certitude:
         
                                                s_C=(1.-min(s_T,s_F),
         
         can be compared to the certitude of another variable node j already assigned:
         if the bias s_C associated to variable node j is smaller than the bias s_C associated to i
         then it is useful releasing variable j. Indeed, releasing variable j may help to correct
         mistakes made during previous decimation steps.
         In other words, decimation steps and backtracking steps choose variables,
         respectively, to  be fixed and to be relased, according to their biases s_C:
         variables to be fixed have the largest biases and variables to be released have the smallest biases.*/
